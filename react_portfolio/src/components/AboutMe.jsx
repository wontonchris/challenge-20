          <p className="is-size-5">
            In my free time, I love playing table tennis, tennis, NBA2k23, and MOBA type games. I find that sports and gaming are a great way to stay active, improve my reflexes, and have fun. When I'm not competing on the court or in the virtual world, you can find me exploring new technologies, playing music, or hiking in the great outdoors.
          </p>
          <p className="is-size-5">
            I am excited to bring my skills and experience to new projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Whether it's solving complex technical challenges or mastering the latest game, I'm always up for a good challenge.
